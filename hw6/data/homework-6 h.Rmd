## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.
```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
tidymodels_prefer(quiet = TRUE)

all_cores <- parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE)

suppressMessages(library(doParallel))
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(all_cores)
registerDoParallel(cl)
```


```{r}
pokemon <- read.csv("/Users/hanshan/Desktop/dev/R_project/PSTAT-231-131/homework-6/data/Pokemon.csv")
cleaned_pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon)
# cleand
cleaned_pokemon <- filter(cleaned_pokemon,type_1 %in% c("Bug", "Fire", "Grass", "Normal", "Water", "Psychic")) %>% 
  mutate(type_1 = factor(type_1),legendary = factor(legendary),generation = factor(generation))
# spilt
pkm_split<-initial_split(cleaned_pokemon,prop=0.80,
                             strata = type_1 )
pkm_train<-training(pkm_split)
pkm_test<-testing(pkm_split)
# k-fold
t_fold <- vfold_cv(pkm_train, v=5)
# recipe
pkm_recipe <- recipe(type_1~legendary+generation+sp_atk+attack+speed+defense+hp+sp_def,data = pkm_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(c(legendary,generation)) %>% 
  step_normalize(all_predictors())


```


### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cor_pkm <- pkm_train %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% #we filter out non-numeric variable
  cor()
  # lsr::correlate()
# rplot(cor_pkm$correlation)
# XX <- cor(pkm_train)
corrplot.mixed(cor_pkm,order = "AOE")
```
Almost all predictors are correlated to a degree and it does not surprise me because they are features of same object (just in terms of one pokemon)

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
# decision tree model
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
# workflow
tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(tree_spec %>% 
              set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ .)
# grid range = c(-3, -1)
pkm_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 5)

# tuning grid
tune_res <- tune_grid(
  tree_wf, 
  resamples = t_fold, 
  grid = pkm_grid 
  # metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
autoplot(tune_res)
```



### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

## For 231 Students

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
